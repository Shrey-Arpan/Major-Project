        Online tutoring programs have gained popularity recently, and 
        several of them are now supported by prestigious colleges. 
        However, due to the low levels of student retention, this popularization,
         which was made feasible by a combination of accessibility, engaging content, 
         and the lack of attendance requirements, is not being genuinely successful.
          The majority of research on online tutoring systems focuses on technical issues or
           implementation examples rather than a more in-depth examination of learner engagement 
           and retention. This project aims to explore commitment in online tutoring systems by a 
           methodical analysis of prior work in many academic databases with the intention 
           of analyzing them from
         the perspective of the engagement of the adolescent student in an online programming course.
